Hi! I’m Duarte, an Associate ML Researcher at [INESC-TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/) (Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science) Porto, Portugal, and a master’s student in [Machine Learning for Health](https://www.uc3m.es/master/machine-learning-health?d=Desktop) at the University Carlos III of Madrid, Spain.

👨🏻‍🔬 My work and research
======

I’m currently part of the [AI4Lungs](https://www.inesctec.pt/pt/projetos/ai4lungs#intro) project at INESC, where I focus on enhancing the explainability and interpretability of AI models for lung cancer applications. Our research covers diverse topics, including detection, prediction, survival analysis, segmentation, and tumor characterization.

For my master’s thesis, I’m collaborating with [Dr. David Izquierdo García](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=pt-PT&user=2HuFxsAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), Assistant Professor in Radiology at Harvard Medical School and Assistant in Biomedical Engineering at Massachusetts General Hospital, to investigate tau protein accumulation in the brain for Alzheimer’s disease prediction.

Additionally, I keep up with the latest developments in Generative AI—a field I’m deeply passionate about and eager to explore further.

Before transitioning to research, I worked at AWS (Amazon Web Services) as a Solutions Architect, helping customers implement cloud solutions. Over time, I specialized in AI/ML use cases, particularly in healthcare, which inspired me to dive into the research behind these technologies.

📚 My background
======

My academic journey started with a bachelor’s degree in Electronics Engineering from [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) in Lisbon, Portugal. This solidified my understanding of computer architecture and hardware fundamentals.

At AWS, I expanded my expertise in cloud infrastructure, databases, DevOps, monitoring, and security for both cloud and on-premises systems. I gained particular proficiency in MLOps, understanding the computational needs for model training and inference, and tools like Docker, Git, and infrastructure as code.

Currently, through my master’s program, I am deepening my knowledge of AI model theory while building specialized skills in medical data processing and analysis.
 

🎶 Other Interests
------
Beyond my technical work, I'm passionate about music, both listening and creating. I also enjoy analog photography, a hobby I actively pursue during my travels and whenever I have an opportunity to bring my camera along.
