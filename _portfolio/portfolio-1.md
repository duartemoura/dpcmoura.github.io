In this project, we developed a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to optimize traffic flow within the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) environment. The DQN agent was trained using Amazon SageMaker, leveraging its robust machine learning capabilities. To emulate real-world scenarios, we simulated data ingestion from IoT devices and applied data preprocessing techniques utilizing AWS analytics services. This approach enabled the reinforcement learning model to make informed decisions, enhancing traffic management strategies.
