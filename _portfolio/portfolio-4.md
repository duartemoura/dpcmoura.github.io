**Generathor** is a pipeline designed to harness the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality question-answer pairs from textual data. These pairs are instrumental in fine-tuning smaller, more efficient LLMs, enhancing their performance on domain-specific tasks.

**Project Overview:**

- **Utilization of Large LLMs**: Employs advanced models like Claude to generate comprehensive question-answer pairs.

- **Fine-Tuning Smaller Models**: Uses the generated data to fine-tune compact LLMs, improving their efficacy in specific domains.

- **Streamlined Dataset Preparation**: Simplifies the process of preparing datasets, facilitating efficient fine-tuning.
