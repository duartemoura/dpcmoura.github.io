In this project, I developed "Dr. Claude," an AI-driven system designed to enhance patient care by providing personalized medical recommendations. The solution integrates Amazon Bedrock with healthcare data to deliver tailored insights to medical professionals.

**Key Components:**

- **Amazon Bedrock Integration**: Utilized Amazon Bedrock's fully managed service to access advanced foundation models via a streamlined API, simplifying the deployment of AI solutions in healthcare.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Implemented RAG techniques to improve the accuracy of medical recommendations by combining large language models with up-to-date medical knowledge bases.

- **Serverless Architecture**: Employed Amazon DynamoDB for efficient management of patient data and Amazon SNS for secure delivery of recommendations to healthcare providers.
