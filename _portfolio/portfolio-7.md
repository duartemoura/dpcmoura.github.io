**Lung CT Registration**

In this project, we developed and implemented algorithms for the registration of lung CT images. The primary objective was to accurately align CT scans to a standardized reference frame, facilitating improved analysis and comparison across different datasets. This process is essential for applications such as disease progression monitoring, treatment planning, and anatomical studies.

### Key Contributions
- **Algorithm Development:** Designed and optimized registration algorithms tailored for lung CT data, ensuring precise alignment while preserving anatomical structures.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Conducted comprehensive assessments of the registration accuracy using various metrics and validation techniques.
- **Tool Integration:** Integrated the developed algorithms into existing medical imaging workflows, enhancing the efficiency of subsequent analysis tasks.

### Technologies Used
- Python  
- Medical Imaging Libraries (e.g., SimpleITK, NiBabel)  
- Weights & Biases for experiment tracking and visualization
